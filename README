This is a fork of rtl_sdr which supports standalone multi-band demodulation and spectrum frequency display on a Raspberry Pi

For more details please see: http://tubysworld.blogspot.sg

- oeta.c contains the core of the changes in this fork
- run build_oeta to compile. Should you receive any warnings please download the necessary libraries. They are no different to what you would need to compile rtl_sdr
- run start to launch. Usually you would want to have this run automatically upon boot if you want a standalone receiver: just copy .bash_profile .xinitrc_normal .xinitrc_server in root folder.

For hardware connectivity please refer to the blog post
